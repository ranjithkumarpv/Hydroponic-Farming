Hydroponic farming approach for robus smart irrigation system based on IoT and Data Science..


In developing countries like India people are facing lot of issues in the field of agriculture. In many places still people are opting for traditional farming which requires lot of human intervention. Recent past people interest turned towards smart irrigation system rather than traditional farming. With the fast advancement of technology people are rushing towards their work where they donâ€™t have time to spend in farming. In order to help the people who are in urban and metropolitan cities, in this paper an approach of smart irrigation system using Hydroponic farming is implemented which minimizes the use of water and consumes less space. Therefore the work aims to build an automated system by incorporating all the sensor data from the Raspberry pi and sent over the network for IoT server. Eventually stored data will be sent to the web based application which allows user to read the status of their system and can turn on/off the motor to water the system whenever necessary. With this development data analysis is done by collecting all the sensor readings and machine learning is applied to predict the plants growth.
